# This manifest deploys the OpenEBS CStor and CSI control plane components,
# with associated CRs & RBAC rules. This manifest has been verified
# only with different linux flavours and linux distros
#
# For supporting a differnet OS other than the above,
# 1) Get the list of shared object files required for iscsiadm binary in that OS version.
# 2) Check which files are already present in the cstor-csi-driver container present in csi node pod.
# 3) Mount the required missing files inside the container.
