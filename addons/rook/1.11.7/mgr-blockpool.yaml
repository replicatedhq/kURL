  # If the built-in Ceph pool used by the Ceph mgr needs to be configured with alternate
  # settings, create this pool with any of the pool properties. Create this pool immediately

  # pool by default.

spec:
  # The required pool name with underscores cannot be specified as a K8s resource name, thus we override
  # the pool name created in Ceph with this name property.
  # The ".mgr" pool is called "device_health_metrics" in Ceph versions v16.x.y and below.
