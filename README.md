kURL
====================================

kURL is a Kubernetes installer for airgapped and online clusters.

kURL relies on `kubeadm` to bring up the Kubernetes control plane, but there are a variety of tasks a system administrator must perform both before and after running kubeadm init in order to have a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, such as installing Docker, configuring Pod networking, or installing kubeadm itself.
The purpose of this installer is to automate those tasks so that any user can deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a single script.
