kURL
====================================

kURL is a Kubernetes installer for airgapped and online clusters.

kURL relies on `kubeadm` to bring up the Kubernetes control plane, but there are a variety of tasks a system administrator must perform both before and after running kubeadm init in order to have a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, such as installing Docker, configuring Pod networking, or installing kubeadm itself.
The purpose of this installer is to automate those tasks so that any user can deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a single script.

## Getting Started
For more information please see [kurl.sh/docs/](https://kurl.sh/docs/)

# Community

For questions about using kURL, there's a [Replicated Community](https://help.replicated.com/community) forum, and a [#kurl channel in Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/channels/kurl).

# Notifications

kURL offers several optional [add-ons](https://kurl.sh/add-ons) for Kubernetes cluster creation. These open-source technology add-ons are distributed under various open-source licenses.

One optional add-on available for object storage is [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio). Use of MinIO is governed by the GNU AGPLv3 license that can be found in their [License](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

One optional add-on available for Metrics & Monitoring is Prometheus via the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator), which includes Grafana. Use of Grafana is currently governed by the GNU AGPL v3 license that can be found in their [License](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/LICENSE) file. 

# Releases

For details on each release, see [kurl.sh/release-notes](https://kurl.sh/release-notes).

Release assets and changelog are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kURL/releases) page.

Releases are created by a GitHub Workflow when a tag is pushed.
The tag should follow the date format `vYYYY.MM.DD-#`.

See the following example:

```
git tag -a v2021.06.22-0 -m "Release v2021.06.22-0" && git push origin v2021.06.22-0
```

# Software Bill of Materials
Signed SBOMs for kURL Go and Javascript dependencies are combined into a tar file and are included with each release.
- **kots-sbom.tgz** contains SBOMs for Go  and Javascript dependencies
- **kots-sbom.tgz.sig** is the digital signature for kots-sbom.tgz
- **key.pub** is the public key from the key pair used to sign kots-sbom.tgz 
 
The following example illustrates using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify that **kots-sbom.tgz** has 
not been tampered with.
```shell
$ cosign verify-blob -key key.pub -signature kots-sbom.tgz.sig kots-sbom.tgz
Verified OK
```
