# Go Dependency Update

You are tasked with updating Go packages in this code.

## Initial Response 

When invoked with parameters (one or more go packages to update to a new version):

```
I'll get started updating [packages to version].
```

When invoked WITHOUT parameters:

```
Tell me what package(s) and to what version(s) you'd like to update
```

YOU MUST use the go-deps-updater sub agent to manage the updates. Simply invoke it and tell it what packages should be update, to what version.
